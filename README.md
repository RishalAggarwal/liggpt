# LigGPT
In this work, we train small custom GPT on Moses and Guacamol dataset with next token prediction task. The model is then used for unconditional and conditional molecular generation. We compare our model with previous approaches on the Moses and Guacamol datasets. Saliency maps are obtained for interpretability using Ecco library.
